### Our invitation
Join us for another year of SoCraTes UK happening on {{ site.event_details.date }}! The event is hosted at [Milton Hill House, UK][location] which is surrounded by 22 acres of landscaped grounds and forest, delivering tranquil setting and backdrop.

Four possible days of exchanging with fellow crafters:

- An add-on [training day][training_day_page], where the sessions are set in advance (in the spirit of the [Foundations day at SoCraTes Germany][socrates_de_foundations]);
- Two full days of [Open Space Unconference][open_space_unconference] plus extra time for getting to know fellow crafters from all experience levels;
- A free-form day of activities, community led, to expand on the topics discussed during the open space, or anything else!

We will allocate tickets on a first-come first-serve basis.

Scroll down for more information, especially our [Code of Conduct][coc_page] and Priority Tickets.


### What’s included in the price?

The ticket includes the booked room, breakfast, lunch and dinner. Biscuits, coffee, tea and water will be available throughout the day. Drinks at the bar are **not** included.

We do not make any profit from the ticket price. The price might be reduced by [sponsorships][sponsorship_page], so make sure to spread the word so all attendees can benefit from cheaper tickets!

Food that respects your dietary preferences will be provided Thursday dinner till Sunday lunch. Water, tea, coffee and refreshments and the accommodation in beautiful rooms in the house itself is included.

The venue has amazing grounds to relax and wander in and boast a gym, sauna, steam room, indoor pool and tennis court if you fancy.

The training day is paid for separately (and includes lunch on Thursday).

### What are the COVID mitigations?

COVID-19 rates across Europe are still high. We want to keep attendees safe, while at the same time allowing for as much familiarity and community spirit as is possible. For this reason our policy at the conference will be:

<ul>
<li>masks will be provided and should be worn in all indoor conference spaces (except while eating/drinking)</li>
<li>lateral flow tests will be provided for each day (conference organisers should be notified if the test is positive)</li>
</ul>

### What if I don’t know anyone in the crafter community?

A new group can be intimidating, but we hope you give SoCraTes a try. The SoCraTes community aims to be open and inclusive to everyone. In addition, we are hoping to provide some [Conference Buddies][conference_buddies] so you can attend together.

<br>

### What should I know before deciding to attend?
By booking, you agree to follow our [Code of Conduct][coc_page]. Please read our full code of conduct before buying a ticket, discussing online and before participating to the event. But please don't feel intimidated by it - these are simple rules, and they will make life better for everyone at the event.

We will have some priority tickets reserved and free for under-indexed groups in tech. Details will follow shortly.

<br>

### How much does it cost?

We sell tickets for the open space at £725. This will likely be reduced by [sponsorships][sponsorship_page], which will be equally applied to all tickets. We will refund the difference.

The training day is £358. There is an option to arrive the Wednesday evening for an extra £110 (accomodation + dinner & breakfast).
