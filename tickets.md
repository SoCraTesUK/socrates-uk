### Our invitation
Join us for another year of SoCraTes UK happening on {{ site.event_details.date }}! The event is currently hosted online.

One full day of [Open Space Unconference][open_space_unconference] plus extra time for getting to know fellow crafters from all experience levels.

Scroll down for more information, especially our [Code of Conduct][coc_page] and Priority Tickets.


### What’s included in the price?

The ticket includes access to the tools used to run the open space online, such as Zoom and Notions.

The ticket price covers the cost of running these tools and we do not make any profit from it.

### What if I don’t know anyone in the crafter community?
A new group can be intimidating, but we hope you give SoCraTes a try. The SoCraTes community aims to be open and inclusive to everyone. In addition, we are hoping to provide some [Conference Buddies][conference_buddies] so you can attend together.

<br>

### What should I know before deciding to attend?
By booking, you agree to follow our [Code of Conduct][coc_page]. Please read our full code of conduct before buying a ticket, discussing online and before participating to the event. But please don't feel intimidated by it - these are simple rules, and they will make life better for everyone at the event.

We have some priority tickets reserved for under-indexed groups in tech. Fill in [this form][priority_ticket_form] to signal that you're part of either/both groups. We trust that you know best if it applies to you.
