This year, we are running an optional Training Day ahead of the open space (inspired by the [Foundations day at SoCraTes Germany][socrates_de_foundations]). 

Are you new to the software industry, and want to get a head start? Have you been practicing for a while, but always thought there had to be some deeper method to it? Have you heard about test-driven development, refactoring, or connascence, and always wanted to learn more about them?

## An Extra Day

The Training Day is intended to open up the world of crafting and testing for newcomers and allow a deep-dive into certain topics. It offers a guided introduction to the conference experience. And provides an easy way to have all the questions you will probably arrive with answered by experienced practitioners.

Unlike the rest of the conference, this day does not follow the [OpenSpace Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology) format. There will be two "themes": crafting and testing. You will be able to choose your favorite sessions freely from either theme to combine your own program.

Sessions will cover foundational topics - the roots of what our community is about - taught by tenured and distinguished community members with years of practical experience. There will also be sessions that take a deeper look at these topics.

## Programme

We are working on exactly who and what. In the meantime, we're delighted to share with you some of the speakers who are confirmed and their topics.

## Can I still join the OpenSpace?

We welcome practitioners and learners at all levels at SoCraTes - because we believe that sharing, teaching and learning are equally important to the community health, and that this is a fundamental part of what makes SoCraTes the magical place it is. Training Day is intended to build bridges and make it easier to join the community, not to create an extra entry barrier.

So yes, you can join the OpenSpace whatever your level, and whether or not you have attended the Training Day.

## Cost

Training Day is not part of the regular SoCraTes UK programme. It requires both extra preparation - especially for the session hosts - and additional cost. As a consequence, you will have to pay a cover charge of Â£358 to attend.
