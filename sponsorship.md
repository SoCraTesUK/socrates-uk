## Sponsorship

Socrates UK is a non-profit conference organised by and for the Software Craftsmanship community. As a free to attend conference, our attendees only need to pay for their hotel room. As such, we rely heavily on our sponsors to reduce the overall cost of attendance and in exchange, we provide exposure (and well deserved Kudos!) to all of our sponsors.

We recognise that our sponsors want to support Socrates UK in different ways, hence why we have more options now than ever before. So whether you'd like to secure a package that includes guaranteed tickets for your colleagues, or whether you're looking to support on a 'pay what you like basis', [send us an email to find out how you can help][socratesuk@codurance.com]
