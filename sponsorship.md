## Sponsorship

SoCraTes UK is a non-profit conference organised by and for the Software Crafters community. As a free to attend conference,
our attendees only need to pay for their hotel room. As such, we rely heavily on our sponsors to reduce
the overall cost of attendance and in exchange, we provide exposure (and well deserved Kudos!) to all of our sponsors.

### Why sponsor SoCraTes UK?

SoCraTes brings together a community of software professionals who care about creating high-quality, maintainable software, and want to work together to share and build on their skills.  
<br>
As an unconference with no predetermined agenda, SoCraTes is created by its participants. As a result, it attracts highly engaged, collaborative practitioners, and encourages dense networks of ideas.  
<br>
By sponsoring SoCraTes, you can demonstrate that you share these values of collaboration and continuous improvement in software development. If you are recruiting, then this is a great way to reach out to a community of highly engaged potential candidates.  
<br>
This year we are also offering an optional, pre-conference Training Day, where participants can benefit from two tracks delivered by world-class practitioners, trainers, and coaches.  
<br>
Below is a list of the sponsorship packages that we’re offering. If you don’t see one that fits your requirements, please get in touch with us to discuss your needs.
