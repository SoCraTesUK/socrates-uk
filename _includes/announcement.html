<h2 class="display-3 text-center">Resuming in-person 2023</h2>
<p>Dear Software Crafters,</p>

<p>We are happy to announce that we are returning to an in-person event for 2023.</p>
<p>COVID-19 rates across Europe are still high. We want to keep attendees safe, while at the same time allowing for as much familiarity and community spirit as is possible. For this reason our policy at the conference will be:
<ul>
<li>masks will be provided and should be worn in all indoor conference spaces (except while eating/drinking)</li>
<li>lateral flow tests will be provided for each day (conference organisers should be notified if the test is positive)</li>
</ul></p>

<p>So what next?</p>

<p>We are now preparing for SoCraTes UK {{ site.event_details.year }} on {{ site.event_details.date }}! Keep subscribed to the newsletter (scroll down) and watch our <a href="contact.html">Twitter feed</a> for updates or help us organise on <a href="contact.html">Slack</a>.</p>
<p>Any thoughts or questions, just drop us <a href="contact.html">an email</a>.</p>
