<h2 class="display-3 text-center">Transformation of SoCraTes UK 2020</h2>
<p>Dear Software Crafters,</p>

<p>In light of the continuing COVID-19 situation, we are running a series of <i>Digital</i> edition: 1-day online events throughout the year instead of the in-person SoCraTes UK 2020 event in June. We aim to provide a bit of that magic that we were all looking forward to.</p>

<p>We have organised SoCraTes UK Digital <a href="digital-2020-spring.html">Spring</a> 2020 in May, and <a href="digital-2020-spring.html">Summer</a> in August.

<p>So what next?</p>

We are now preparing for <a href="digital-2020-autumn.html">SoCraTes UK Digital Autumn</a> on the {{ site.event_details.date }}! Keep subscribed to the newsletter and watch our Twitter feed for updates or help us organise on Slack.</p>
<p>Any thoughts or questions, just drop us an email.</p>

<p>Your organisers<br>
Juke, Tom, Ian, Jakob, Nick, Sharath, Tania, Am√©lie
