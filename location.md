The best place to find out how to get there is [Milton Hill House's site][MiltonHillHouse].

The nearest station is Didcot Parkway Station. It is 4 miles and 16 minutes’ drive away. There are local taxis available to get from Didcot station to the venue.

Please check our wiki for the [local taxi companies][].

Didcot Parkway rail station has links and connections from London Paddington station, Heathrow and Gatwick airport.

Heathrow Airport is about 1 hour drive from the venue and Gatwick Airport about 1h30.

__TAXIS:__ If using taxis, either use [Uber][] or one of the [local taxi companies][] listed on the wiki. They are much cheaper. Be aware that they normally ask you to wait for them at the departures "drop off" and you will need to make your way there from the arrivals. 

The fastest way to get to London from any airport is by train. Take a look at [National Rail][] for routes, times, prices and to book your tickets. If you are coming in a group, bear in mind you could save money. Three or four people travelling together pay for only two tickets if the service is off-peak (remember, you need to get these group tickets at the ticket office, rather than online or using the ticket machines at the train station).

You normally can get direct trains to Didcot Parkway from London Paddington station. The train fare should cost from £32 each way when bough in advance [GWR][] (2 singles seem cheaper than a return...). When buying your train ticket, go to the ticket office instead of buying on the machines and show your tube ticket as you may get more than 50% discount — they will charge you only for the stretch beyond the zones you already paid for when coming to central London from the airport. That's the same for people with Oyster cards.

If you prefer to get to London by coach, [National Express][National Express from airports] is probably the best option, with wi-fi on their coaches.
