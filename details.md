### Costs

This is a non-profit gathering and the only fees will be hotel accommodation (including meals & non-alcoholic beverages) and transportation to the venue. All attendees, including the organisers, will be paying these fees.

Eventbrite will be used for registration, with an up-front **non-refundable deposit** required to secure a ticket.

The final balance, which includes the deposit, will be settled upon checking out of the hotel.

We are also looking to secure **sponsorship** which will go directly towards bringing the ticket costs down. If you are interested in sponsoring SoCraTes UK, take a look at the [Sponsorship page][Sponsorship] and [please get in touch][socratesuk-info@googlegroups.com].

<em>We will update with more information about the costs as soon as possible.</em>

	<p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign" aria-hidden="true"></span> Note, <strong>the deposit is non-refundable.</strong> <br /><br />If after you bought the ticket you realise you can't make it, you can sell it to someone else. Send us the name of the person that will be attending in your place.<br /><br /> <strong>You will be liable for paying the remaining amount to the hotel during check out </strong>— you will have a room booked in your name.</p>

#### Twin Room:
Buying a ticket for a twin room means that you are reserving **one** bed in a twin room. If you want to make sure that you and a friend can share the same room, we recommend you buy the two tickets together. If you'd like to share a room with someone you already know, don't worry: go to the our <a href='https://github.com/lscc/socrates-uk/wiki'>wiki</a> and register your preference.
