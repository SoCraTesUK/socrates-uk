### Costs

This is a non-profit gathering and the only fees will be hotel accommodation (including meals & non-alcoholic beverages) and transportation to the venue. All attendees, including the organisers, will be paying these fees.

Eventbrite will be used for registration, with an up-front **non-refundable deposit** required to secure a ticket.

The final balance, which includes the deposit, will be settled upon checking out of the hotel.

We are also looking to secure **sponsorship** which will go directly towards bringing the ticket costs down. If you are interested in sponsoring SoCraTes UK, take a look at the [Sponsorship page][Sponsorship] and [please get in touch][socratesuk@codurance.com].

The best place to find out how to get there is [Wotton House's site][WottonHouse].

[WottonHouse]: http://www.wottonhousedorkingsurrey.co.uk/location/

The nearest station is Dorking station. It is 3-4 miles and 15 minutes’ drive away. A one way taxi should cost between £12 and £30 depending on traffic.

Please check our wiki for the [local taxi companies][]. __Please note that most taxis near Dorking Station don’t accept cards and the only cash machine to withdraw the money at the station is usually out of service, so make sure you have cash on hand.__

Dorking rail station has direct links and connections from London Waterloo, London Victoria, Reading and Gatwick airport.

Gatwick Airport is about 30 minutes from the venue. Uber taxis will cost £25-33 while black cabs in the airport will cost on average £64.00 depending on the traffic. Taxi will be the fastest way to get to the venue as you don't need to come to London and then back to Dorking.

Heathrow Airport is about 40 minutes to 1 hour from Wotton House, depending on traffic, and Uber taxis should cost £38-51. Black cabs in the airport may cost up to £100.00.

__TAXIS:__ If using taxis, either use [Uber][] or one of the [local taxi companies][] listed on the wiki. They are much cheaper. Be aware that they normally ask you to wait for them at the departures "drop off" and you will need to make your way there from the arrivals. 

The fastest way to get to London from any airport is by train. Take a look at [National Rail][] for routes, times, prices and to book your tickets. If you are coming in a group, bear in mind you could save money. Three or four people travelling together pay for only two tickets if the service is off-peak (remember, you need to get these group tickets at the ticket office, rather than online or using the ticket machines at the train station).

You normally can get direct trains to Dorking from London Waterloo, Vauxhall or Victoria tube stations. The train fare should cost around £11.60. When buying your train ticket, go to the ticket office instead of buying on the machines and show your tube ticket as you may get more than 50% discount—they will charge you only for the stretch beyond the zones you already paid for when coming to central London from the airport. That's the same for people with Oyster cards. 

If you prefer to get to London by coach, [National Express][National Express from airports] is probably the best option, with wi-fi on their coaches.
